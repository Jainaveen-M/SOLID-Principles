/*
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules,
both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).
Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details,but details should depend on abstractions.

Explanation:
---------------

NotificationService Interface:
------------------------------
This is the abstraction. Both EmailService and SMSService implement this interface. This means UserService no longer depends on any specific serviceâ€”it only relies on the interface.

Low-level Modules (EmailService, SMSService):
--------------------------------------------
These are the low-level modules that implement the NotificationService interface. Each one has its own implementation of sendMessage().

High-level Module (UserService):
---------------------------------
The UserService class depends on the NotificationService interface (abstraction). In the constructor, we inject a NotificationService implementation (either EmailService or SMSService).
UserService can work with any class that implements NotificationService without needing any changes.

Dependency Injection:
----------------------
In main(), we inject the specific services (EmailService or SMSService) into UserService. This makes the code flexible and easy to modify or test.

Benefits:
-----------
Loosely Coupled: UserService no longer needs to know the details of EmailService or SMSService. It can work with any notification service that implements NotificationService.
Testability: In tests, you can easily substitute NotificationService with a mock implementation.
